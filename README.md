# Tesla-Gen3-Charger
Reverse Engineering of the Tesla Gen3 charger and development of an open source control board 

05/04/18 : Added CAN capture of all 3 phase modules and logic board. Seems very similar to the GEN2 in terms of message IDs and structure.
Also added initial pinout for connector from logic board to phase modules.
CAN bus runs at 500kbps

29/09/18 : V1 design files released for the controller featuring Wifi access!. Completely untested. Educational use only. Do not blame me if you blow up yourself, your cat or car using this information! More information and prototype build and test coming soon.


21/01/19 : Uploaded pinout and connector information.
